# Healthcare-Insurance-Claims-Reporting-System

Business Value: Developed a Relational Database Architecture for storing Healthcare insurances claims data, designed insightful optimized queries and interactive visualizations with a goal of formulating key ad-hoc dynamic reports and dashboards using MySQL Workbench and Tableau. 

# Project Overview

Data Set Description:

Researched Health Insurance websites and generated custom dataset which involved information pertaining to the insurance providers, insurance claims, insurance coverage, insurance claim status, claim payments and member demographics.

Action Plan:

1) Preprocessed dataset tables in order to make it standardized and consistent. 
1) Designed a Logical Entity-Relationship diagram, defined constraints and relationships using join operations while populating the data tables.
2) Converted database tables into 3NF form with a goal of reducing redundancy in the database. 
3) Formulated optimized queries using join operations and fine-tuned them by creating Views, Stored Procedures and Indexing.
4) Explored dataset and summarized key findings into an interactive dashboard designed using Tableau which eased the job of story telling and decision making. 

# Technologies Used:

Data Analysis technologies: MS Excel, Python.
Database Managemen Tools: MySQL, MySQL Workbench.
Data Visualization tool: Tableau.
